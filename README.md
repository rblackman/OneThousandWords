One Thousand Words
==================

A simple program to convert a text document into an image. (Or convert an image back into a text document). 

Usage
-----

Simply place the PNG image or text file in the input directory, run the program, and look in the output directory at what it generates.

Disclaimer
----------

This was thrown together in one evening just for fun. It hasn't been throughly tested and the code most likely sucks.
